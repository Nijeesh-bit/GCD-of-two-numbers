# Find the GCD of two numbers

## AIM:
To write a program to find the GCD of two numbers using function.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Define a function.
2. Get the two numbers from the user.
3. import math libary
4. Use the math.gcd function
5. print the output
6. End the program

## Program:
```Python
import math
def gcd():
    return math.gcd(a,b)
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
print("GCD of two numbers is:",gcd())
```

## Output:

## Result:
Thus the program to find the GCD of two numbers is written and verified using python programming.
